# Copy this file to `secrets.toml` and update with your actual credentials.
# The secrets.toml file is gitignored and should never be committed.
#
# Usage:
#   cp secrets-example.toml secrets.toml
#   # Edit secrets.toml with your real keys
#
# These example credentials are for the fakenet test network and are safe to
# include in this example file. DO NOT use these keys on mainnet or with real funds.

# Server's wallet v1 public key hash (base58-encoded)
# This is the PKH that will be used to send cashout transactions to players
wallet_pkh = "9yPePjfWAdUnzaQKyxcRXKRa5PpUzKKEwtpECBZsUYt9Jd7egSDEWoV"

# Server's private key (base58-encoded schnorr seckey)
# IMPORTANT: Keep this secret! Anyone with this key can spend your funds.
# The example key below is for fakenet testing only.
private_key = "7VnoWdeQBFLxQAwwqmWnjY4tN6MjKFXRZivPje9t2iRT"

# To generate your own keys:
# 1. Use the wallet CLI tool or nockchain utilities
# 2. Generate a new v1 keypair
# 3. Export the PKH and private key in base58 format
# 4. Replace the values above with your credentials
